             <p id="text"> After finishing my years of study in high school,
                 I naturally went to computer science, 
                 I would particularly like to study engineering specializing in cybersecurity for this 
                 I intend to opt for the cybersecurity option for my second year 
                 at the IUT, I think that this position offers good prospects for 
                 the future, more companies are looking for this type of position 
                 so I could quickly find a job.</p> </br>
             <img id="cyber" src="../Images/cyber.jpg"></br>
             <p id="text">
                During my second year I would like to participate in the work-study program indeed
Doing work-study will allow me to acquire important professional
 experience. I will develop the skills acquired during the
 theoretical courses and put the knowledge into practice. 
 Then if I work for a year in a company and acquire professional
  experience, it helps me greatly to find work when I leave school.
