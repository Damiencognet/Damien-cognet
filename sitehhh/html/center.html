                    <p class="text-over">Since I was very young I have been fascinated by what a trip represents, I still remember the first time I was able to fly at five years old, I was frightened by the speed and the risks that it represented. Today I think I'm used to planes, after all I had the chance to visit many countries and discover new cultures completely different from mine, I was able to visit; Italy, Austria, Mexico, Ireland, and many other countries. But the one that completely made me dream was the United States, the city of New York and its skyscrapers still shocks me today, I want to go back there one day but this time alone and enjoy at my own pace</p>

                    <p class="text-over">Football is a great distraction. It allows me in particular to distract myself, to evacuate stress and to recharge my batteries. Alone or with a group of friends, following beautiful posters is a real pleasure. With this passion, we develop both team spirit and competition.C’est un jeu simple,c’est un drame qui fait éprouver toutes les émotions en une heure et demie : on va passer de la joie à la tristesse, de l’angoisse à la révolte. It's a simple game, it's a drama that makes you feel all the emotions in an hour and a half: we will go from joy to sadness, from anxiety to revolt</p>

                    <p class="text-over">In my opinion, music represents all that is most beautiful to know, to express, to discover and to listen to, . All these reasons mean that music has a big place in my life and it has been from a very young age. And in the most difficult and complex moments that I have been able to go through, music has freed me. When I spent months in deep depression over the loss of a loved one, She made me forget things were wrong and gave me hope.
